# my fash -aka FireShell

<p>The shell is still minimal and can do a few things, its just for me to strengthen my use of C.</p>

<p> The shell commands run similar to bash, any command input initiates a search for the binary. So for you to use any of your favorite commands, you need to ensure the binary exists.</p>

<p> Later i will add the neccessary binaries as deemed fit, but it will take time. You can contribute them also. </p>

<p>The code was compiled with </p>
   <code>gcc *.c -o fash </code>
<p>compile it similarly</p>

<h3>Config</h3>
<p>The config folder contains the config files the program needs to run.</p>

<h3>fbin</h3>
<p>The fbin folder contains installed binaries which are executed when commands are given </p>

<h3>Source</h3>
<p>The source contains the source code for the bin files</p>
