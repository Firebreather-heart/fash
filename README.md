# my fash -aka FireShell

# The shell is still minimal and can do a few things, its just for me to strengthen my use of C.

# The shell commands run similar to bash, any command input initiates a search for the binary. So for you to use any of your favorite commands, you need to ensure the binary exists.

# Later i will add the neccessary binaries as deemed fit, but it will take time. You can contribute them also. 

# The code was compiled with 
   gcc *.c -o fash 

compile it similarly
